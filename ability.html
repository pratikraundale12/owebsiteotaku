        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 8 (Boring)</p>
        <p>Inumaki is easily one of the most fascinating characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. The fact that he can only use a
            limited vocabulary to convey his points highlights the fact that his Cursed Technique is incredibly powerful
            perhaps more than he can control himself. <br>
            <br>
            His Cursed Speech allows Inumaki to control the actions of his enemies by shouting orders that are powered
            by his Cursed Energy. Such a powerful technique takes a huge toll on his body, with Inumaki being rendered
            unable to speak if he ends up overusing this technique.

        <p>Technique Debut: Chapter 205 (Stars and Oil)</p>
        <p>Kenjaku is a heinous curse user who has remained alive for many years with an ability that lets him
            transplant his brain into others, rendering him immortal until the brain itself is taken out. Not only does
            this curse user take on the abilities of its possessed body, but Kenjaku can also use Domain Expansion to
            completely decimate his enemies if he wishes. <br>
            <br>
            Womb Profusion, his Domain Expansion, is a disgusting technique to witness firsthand. He forms a pillar made
            entirely out of cursed spirits that can hit enemies for massive damage, essentially killing any unprepared
            foe who has no idea just how powerful this Domain Expansion technique really is. The fact that the true
            power of this technique hasn't been properly seen yet is a shame.

        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 1 (Ryomen Sukuna)</p>
        <p>Megumi is poised to become one of the most unique and engaging characters in Jujutsu Kaisen. His Ten Shadows
            power might be fairly weak right now, but its sheer potential is limitless. It's going to take Megumi quite
            some time to master this technique, but there's no denying that watching him use the Ten Shadows technique
            at its maximum potential is going to be an absolute blast. <br>
            <br>
            If Megumi manages to hone his ability to a T, there's no telling what this man will be capable of. However,
            he has been on the back foot in most of his battles, which does take away a bit from the power of his
            technique.

        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 168 (Tokyo No. 1 Colony, Part 8)s</p>
        <p>It takes something really special for a relatively new jujutsu sorcerer to showcase an ability so powerful
            that Gojo himself acknowledges just how dangerous this power really is. Fumihiko is a character introduced
            during the Culling Game who has the power to turn his jokes into reality, which means that the sky's the
            limit for this powerful Cursed Technique. <br>
            <br>
            The only respite that most of his opponents have is that Fumihiko himself is unaware of just how powerful
            this ability is. There are times when he can lose faith in his own jokes, which is understandable given his
            status as a failed comedian. Still, it's oddly unnerving to see a character who has so much power that they
            themselves don't know how to control it, making it easy to see why fighting this sorcerer can be pretty
            challenging indeed.

    <div class="char-info">
        <p>Technique Debut: Chapter 215 (Fearsome Womb, Part 7)</p>
        <p>It goes to say that Sukuna has some of the most powerful abilities in the history of the series. There's a
            reason why even the toughest Jujutsu Sorcerers fear his presence since this Malevolent Being can level
            entire buildings and tear apart any enemy that may be unlucky enough to stand in his way. <br>
            <br>
            One of his abilities that essentially magnifies his Cleave technique to his surroundings is Spiderweb,
            leaving a huge trail of destruction in its wake. Any person unlucky to be caught in this attack will be
            sliced into ribbons in no time at all, which can make for a rather unceremonious demise indeed.

        <p>Technique Debut: Episode 20 (Nonstandard)</p>
        <p>Combining both the Red and Blue powers of Gojo's Limitless technique makes for a brilliant spectacle of
            explosive power. Gojo wastes no time in bringing out this move during the Goodwill Event when Hanami starts
            wreaking havoc. <br>
            <br>
            This technique is so powerful that Hanami would've been completely obliterated had it not been for his swift
            thinking. The true potential of this technique is yet to be seen, and fans can't wait for Gojo to whip out
            this technique once again in a later season of Jujutsu Kaisen.
