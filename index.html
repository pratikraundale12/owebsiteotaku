        <p>Domain Expansion is the most supreme technique of any jujutsu user. It is achieved by expanding one's innate
            domain with cursed energy while using a barrier to construct it inside a separate space. The caster then
            imbues their cursed technique within the barrier to complete the expansion, allowing them to deploy their
            ability all throughout the domain.
            <br>
            A specific hand sign or signal unique to the user is required to expand someone's respective domain.From the
            outside, a domain's barrier is normally completely closed, making it appear as a floating black sphere that
            can even be moved slightly if needed

            Jujutsu High assigns their sorcerer's grades to assess their skill level ascending from Grade 4 to Grade 1.
            Students generally start at Grade 4 upon joining the school, but this depends on experience.[1]

            Cursed spirits are ranked on a similar scale but not exact. The higher-ups can be particular when it comes
            to ranking cursed spirits. The distinct difference between a grade 2 and a semi-grade 1 curse is whether or
            not it is capable of using cursed techniques. <br>
            <br>
            Jujutsu sorcerers are expected to take on missions involving curses of the same level. A Grade 2 sorcerer
            should be able to defeat a Grade 2 curse because their skill level is closer to the strength of a Grade 1
            curse.
        </p>
        <ul class="order">
            <li> Grade 4 - "A wooden bat is enough."</li>
            <li> Grade 3 - "If you have a handgun, you can rest easy."</li>
            <li>Grade 2 - "Close call with a shotgun."</li>
            <li>Grade 1 - "Even a tank might be insufficient."</li>
            <li>Special Grade - "Cluster bombs might work."</li>

    <div class="char-info">
        <p>A cursed technique is activated through the act of pouring cursed energy into it, utilizing one of two
            processes; Lapse or Reversal. If cursed energy is comparable to electricity, cursed techniques are the
            appliances that use that power to function. Cursed energy is processed through a procedure akin to a
            mathematic formula within the user to activate a cursed technique.
            <br>
            <br>1. Lapse <br>
            Lapse (順転 Junten?, lit. "Forward Rotation") refers to the basic, default, or neutral state of activation for
            a cursed technique. To activate a cursed technique through lapse, the caster circulates their cursed energy
            in a forward direction to channel it into their ability.
            <br>
            Note: The Cursed Technique Lapse of the Limitless is a reinforced version of its Lapse that's activated when
            the technique is used to strengthen cursed energy.
            Reversal
            Reversal (反転 Hanten?, lit. "Reverse Rotation") produces positive energy by multiplying negative energy with
            negative energy. Negative energy isn't suitable for recovering but positive energy can heal physical
            injuries. However, it requires highly sophisticated manipulation of cursed energy to achieve, so the ability
            to do so is rare.
            <br>
            <br>*2. Subtraction <br>
            "To excel at jujutsu is to excel at subtraction."

            Cursed techniques often require hand signs (掌しゅぅ印いん Shōin?), empowered words (呪じゅ詞し Jushi?), or other
            gestures to activate. A sorcerer's skill is determined by the degree to which they can minimize and omit
            these components to make their abilities more efficient. Conversely, the purposeful inclusion of
            incantations or rituals can elevate a cursed technique's effectiveness.

        <p>The Six Eyes were always bound to Master Tengen and the Star Plasma Vessel by fate. At some point in the
            past, Kenjaku was defeated by two different users of the Six Eyes. After his second defeat, Kenjaku did not
            take any chances and killed another Six Eyes user a month after they were born. Despite Kenjaku doing the
            same to the Star Plasma Vessel, the Six Eyes reappeared alongside a new Star Plasma Vessel on the day of the
            merger. <br>
            <br>
            This connection was severed by Toji Fushiguro, a man who escaped cursed energy through Heavenly Restriction
            and destroyed all of their destinies. This inevitably led to the current user of the Six Eyes getting sealed
            by Kenjaku.

        <p>The three great sorcerer clans of the jujutsu world are the Zenin Clan, the Gojo Clan, and the Kamo Clan.
            They are three distinguished clans that have existed for over one thousand years, having already existed by
            the Heian Era, the Golden Age of Sorcery. Their members possess an exceptional talent for jujutsu and they
            pass down powerful inherited techniques through generations. <br>
            <br>
            The Big Three Families possess great influence and political prominence in the jujutsu world. Alongside
            jujutsu headquarters, they are in contact with the Japanese government and were key in establishing the
            memorandum regarding the obligations of jujutsu sorcerers. The head of Jujutsu Headquarters is appointed by
            the Prime Minister based on nominations from the Big Three. The principals of both Jujutsu Highs are
            appointed by the head of Jujutsu Headquarters also based on nominations from the Big Three. <br>

        <p>Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪じゅ術じゅつ師し Jujutsushi?) are individuals secretly trained and employed by the government in

            The race of humans capable of using jujutsu are colloquially known as Sorcerers (術じゅつ師し Jutsushi?), and the
            jujutsu prefix is often used to signify their alignment to Jujutsu High. Jujutsu sorcerers who use their
            powers for criminal purposes, such as murder, are called Curse Users (呪じゅ詛そ師し Jusoshi?) while humans who
            cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers (非ひ術じゅつ師し Hijutsushi?).
