        <p>After being killed by Maki during her massacre of the Zenin clan, Naoya came back as a cursed spirit in the
            Culling game, intent on exacting his revenge. The sorcerer's new form gave him much stronger abilities than
            he previously had access to, making him fast enough even to outspend Maki. This also granted him a powerful
            new domain expansion Time Cell Moon Palace, which forced everyone inside it to move at 24 frames per second
            or else get brutally attacked. While Maki was able to break through the technique given her heavenly
            restriction, it still is one of the strongest Domain Expansions in Jujutsu Kaisen.</p>

    <div class="char-info">
        <p>Hiromi Higuruma is a defense attorney who decided to participate in the deadly Culling Game and even become
            one of the top players. Before becoming a jujutsu sorcerer, Hiromi was a noble lawyer who helped those who
            were wrongly accused, even if their cases were impossibly difficult to defend. Despite being naturally
            proficient in Jujutsu sorcery, Hiromi's domain expansion wasn't activated through rigorous training. He
            received his domain expansion when his cursed technique was activated thanks to Kenjaku. <br>
            <br>
            Deadly Sentencing takes shape as a small courtroom, and those caught in it must prove to the judge that they
            are not guilty of the crimes ascribed to them. What's terrifying with Hiromi's Domain Expansion is that even
            he is not aware of the kind of punishment his enemies will receive, whether that's death or removal of their
            cursed technique. Hiromi is proof that no Domain Expansion should be underestimated in Jujustu Kaisen.

    <div class="char-info">
        <p>Smallpox Deity is a cursed spirit summoned by Kenjaku to terrorize the Jujutsu sorcerer Mei Mei and her
            brother Ui Ui. It has a terrifying appearance due to its mouth which has two large tusks and two muscular
            arms that are filled to the brim with pox bumps. The Smallpox Deity is incredibly powerful as it was used by
            Kenjaku to gauge Mei Mei's power and see if she's worthy of facing him. <br>
            <br>
            The Small Pox Deity's Domain Expansion Graveyard Domain traps an opponent inside and guarantees an automatic
            hit for the user. This Domain Expansion coupled with the Deity's Gravestone Technique can spell death for
            even the strongest Jujutsu sorcerers. Being inside the Domain and trapped by the Gravestone technique can
            fulfill the conditions of the Smallpox Deity's powers and infect the victim with smallpox, leading to their
            death.

        <p>Being a 2nd-grade sorcerer, it's impressive that Megumi was able to conjure his own Domain Expansion. Though
            his Chimera Shadow Garden was still incomplete and had its flaw, with the right mindset it can easily
            exorcise a special grade. Additionally, Megumi is a descendant of Jujutsu Kaisen's Zenin clan, one of the 3
            major sorcerer families and he possesses the sacred Ten Shadows Technique, which can only be inherited and
            allows him to summon ten different shikigami. Megumi is also able to store sacred weapons in his shadows,
            which proves invaluable in his fights. <br>
            <br>
            Megumi likely possesses more potential than any other character outside of Jujutsu Kaisen's hero, Yuji
            Itadori. In the series “Cursed Womb” arcs, he is praised for his innate abilities by both Sukuna who is the
            greatest cursed spirit, and Gojo who is the strongest jujutsu sorcerer. All of this adds up to Megumi's
            Domain Expansion having some of the greatest potential in the entire series..

    <div class="char-info">
        <p> In Mahito’s fight against Yuji and Nanami, fans got to witness his growth in real-time, culminating with the
            release of his Domain Expansion. Mahito is already more dangerous than the average special-grade cursed
            spirit as his touch he can alter his target’s soul. Mahito ranks high among Jujutsu Kaisen's strongest
            Domain Expansions in spite of being a newer and more immature cursed spirit. While younger and less
            experienced than Jogo, Mahito is an unregistered Special Grade cursed spirit and is assessed to possess the
            power of at least three of Sukuna's fingers. <br>
            <br>
            Even before his Domain Expansion, Mahito’s natural ability is a one-hit knockout, which makes his domain
            expansion incredibly powerful. Fans are also clamoring for Mahito to get a focus episode due to his sheer
            ability and power, as well as his backstory. If not for Yuji’s intervention, Mahito’s Domain Expansion would
            have easily killed a Grade 1 sorcerer like Nanami.

        <p> Hakari's Idle Death Gamble may be the most confusing Domain Expansion in Jujutsu Kaisen but it is also one
            of the most powerful. Idle Death Gamble takes the form of a giant Pachinko machine that gives Hakari
            different bonuses and attacks based on what he spins. Getting a jackpot with this technique grants Hakari a
            brief period of time when he has access to nigh-infinite Cursed Energy, which essentially makes him
            invincible. After that period ends he can then initiate Idle Death Gamble again and start the whole process
            over. This ability to infinitely recur its technique is what makes Idle Death Gamble one of Jujutsu Kaisen's
            strongest Domain Expansions.

        <p>As the King of all Curses, Sukuna enters Jujutsu Kaisen without competitors. In fact, other cursed spirits’
            strengths are perceived in terms of numbers of Sukuna’s fingers which only demonstrates his overwhelming
            power. Mahito could be considered one of the bravest characters in Jujutsu Kaisen when he attempted to touch
            Yuji and inadvertently Sukuna. He has superior abilities and power over all other curses and most sorcerers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sukuna was originally a human sorcerer who was so powerful that he was thought to be a demon. All of the
            sorcerers of the time had to combine their strength in order to defeat him, but Sukuna's power was so
            resistant that he was reborn as a cursed spirit and his body was too durable to be destroyed. Mahito and
            Jogo spend the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen plotting to get on Sukuna’s good side and return all of his
            fingers. In the first cursed womb battle, Sukuna reveals his Domain Expansion and instantly defeats the
            special grade cursed spirit that overwhelmed Yuji and Megumi.

    <div class="char-info">
        <p>Gojo is not only a likable character due to his charm and looks — but he's also extremely powerful. He is
            introduced in the series as “the strongest” and later confidently boasts that defeating a fully revived
            Sukuna would be “a little draining.” Throughout the first season of Jujutsu Kaisen, every intelligent cursed
            spirit is advised to avoid Gojo and there's good reason for that. <br>
            <br>
            Like Megumi, Gojo possesses several inherited techniques such as Six Eyes, which allows his cursed energy
            usage to be near-infinite, and Limitless, which gives him control over space. In addition to these innate
            abilities, Gojo was also born with high intellect and superior strength, speed, and reflexes. In its reveal,
            Unlimited Void is so powerful that it renders the cursed spirit Jogo in a state of complete paralysis.
